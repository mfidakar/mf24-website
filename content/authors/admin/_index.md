Hi, I am Mohammad Fidakar, a displaced scholar from Afghanistan and currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Economics at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), where I also work with [Dr. O'Connell](https://www.stephenoconnell.org/). I hold a B.A. in Economics from Balkh University in Afghanistan and a Master of Development Policy (MDP) from KDI School in Sejong, South Korea. 

Before joining Emory, I taught undergraduate courses in economics at Ghazni University, where I began my academic career in 2014 and was appointed to lead the university’s research center in 2020.

My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics and political economy, with a focus on conflict, displacement, migration, and social cohesion.

As I step outside work, I find joy in photography— which enables me to take "a closer look" at the beauty of the nature— as well as in gardening and playing soccer.

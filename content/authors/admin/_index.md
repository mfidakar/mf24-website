Hi, I am a displaced scholar from [Ghaznayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazni) (Afghanistan), and an economics PhD student at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I have a master degree in development policy concentrated on sustainable development from South Korea and a bachelor in economics from Afghanistan.  

At GW, I teach courses on comparative political economy, data science and South Asia. I am on faculty in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/) and the [Elliott School of International Affairs](https://elliott.gwu.edu/) and am affiliated with the [Sigur Center for Asian Studies](https://sigur.elliott.gwu.edu/) as well as the Institute for [International Economic Policy](https://iiep.gwu.edu/). 

I also serve as one of the managing editors for the [Journal of Development Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/fjds20/current).
